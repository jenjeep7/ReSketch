## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 16.0+ device or simulator
- Firebase account (free tier works)
- Apple Developer account (for device testing)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jenjeep7/ReSketch.git
   cd ReSketch
   ```

2. **Install Firebase SDK**
   - Open `ReSketch.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Go to File > Add Package Dependencies
   - Add: `https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk`
   - Select: FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore, FirebaseStorage

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Email/Password authentication
   - Create Firestore database and deploy rules from `firestore.rules`
   - Enable Cloud Storage and deploy rules from `storage.rules`
   - Create Firestore index for submissions (see below)
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase Console
   - **IMPORTANT**: Place it in the `ReSketch/` folder (same level as `ReSketchApp.swift`)
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER commit this file to git** - it contains sensitive API keys

4. **Create Firestore Index**
   - Go to Firestore ‚Üí Indexes
   - Create composite index for `submissions` collection:
     - `threadID` (Ascending)
     - `createdAt` (Descending)
   - Or click the auto-generated link when the app requests it

5. **Update Bundle Identifier**
   - Select the ReSketch target
   - Update Bundle Identifier to match your Firebase project (e.g., `com.resketch.app`)
   - Select your development team

6. **Build and Run**
   - Select an iPad simulator or device (recommended)
   - Press ‚åòR to build and run

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

The `GoogleService-Info.plist` file is **excluded from version control** via `.gitignore` because it contains sensitive API keys. 

**If you accidentally committed it:**
1. Remove from git: `git rm --cached ReSketch/GoogleService-Info.plist`
2. Commit the removal: `git commit -m "Remove sensitive config"`
3. **Rotate your API keys** in Firebase Console
4. Download a new `GoogleService-Info.plist`

## üì± User Flow

1. **Sign Up / Sign In**
   - Create account with email, username, display name, password
   - Or sign in with existing credentials

2. **Browse Feed**
   - View all original artwork threads
   - See thread titles, creators, re-sketch counts
   - Tap a thread to view details

3. **View Thread**
   - See the original artwork full-size
   - Browse all re-sketches in a grid
   - Tap "Create Your Re-Sketch" to draw

4. **Create Re-Sketch**
   - Original artwork appears as reference (adjustable opacity)
   - Draw your version using PencilKit tools
   - Toggle reference visibility
   - Submit when complete

5. **Create New Thread**
   - Choose to draw new artwork or upload from photos
   - Add title, description, and tags
   - Create thread to share with community
